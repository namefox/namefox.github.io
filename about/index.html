    <h1>about my work</h1><br>
    <p>i make software and games, using either my own engines or a third-party.</p>
    <p>i don't take this very seriously; i do it mostly just for fun.</p><br>

    <p>this began in 2019, and has improved a lot since then.</p>
    <p>my github account was created so i could control what i did, and to back it up in case something happens.</p>
    <p>few of my old deleted projects were found. the projects that i could find are stored <a href="old/">here</a>.</p><br><br>
